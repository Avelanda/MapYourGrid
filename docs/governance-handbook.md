<h1>MapYourGrid: Governance handbook</h1>
</div>


## **<div class="tools-header">Project overview</div>**

### <div class="tools-header">About the initiative</div>
MapYourGrid is an open-source initiative that develops and integrates tools to help organizations and individuals map power grid infrastructures worldwide in OpenStreetMap. We aim to improve data availability for electrification and climate action. Find our [Mission Statement here](/mission-statement).

### <div class="tools-header">Governance model</div>
MapYourGrid follows a meritocratic contribution-driven governance model, inspired by established open-source foundations.
Active contributors who demonstrate sustained, high-quality participation in the initiative or in OpenStreetMap in general, can be recognized with formal decision-making rights. Authority derives from contribution and trust, not from organizational status or sponsorship.
Decisions are made openly and by consensus whenever possible.

### <div class="tools-header">Scope and Boundaries</div>
This governance applies to MapYourGrid core repositories and affiliated projects without their own governance. Subprojects may later adopt their own models while remaining aligned with MapYourGrid’s values.

### <div class="tools-header">Legal Structure</div>
MapYourGrid is an independent project which currently operates under the fiscal sponsorship of Open Energy Transition (OET).

## **<div class="tools-header">Governance structure</div>**

### <div class="tools-header">Project Management Committee (PMC)</div>

Roles & Responsibilities
The Project Management Committee (PMC) provides strategic guidance and ensures the long-term health of the project and its community. Its key functions include:

* Strategic project direction: Sets long-term priorities and goals for MapYourGrid and affiliated projects.
* Coordination: Facilitates collaboration among maintainers and working groups.
* Conflict resolution: Acts as the final decision body for unresolved technical or interpersonal issues.
* Partnerships: Approves external collaborations, and integration with other open-source ecosystems.
* Budget and resource allocation: Allocates funds, grants, and infrastructure resources.
* Governance policy changes: Proposes and approves modifications to this handbook and other foundational documents.

Eligibility

* Initial composition: Designated representatives from the founding partners form the initial PMC.
* Composition and limits:  A recommended upper limit is 10 members. There is an upper limit of 2 PMC members per organisation. PMC members should act objectively and represent their personal expertise, as well as be aligned with the Mission statement of MapYourGrid. 
* Activity requirements: A member automatically steps down if they neither vote nor attend PMC meetings for four consecutive PMC meetings.
* Removal for cause: A PMC member may be removed through a formal PMC vote (75% majority) in cases of breach of the Code of Conduct, or behavior harmful to the project.
* New appointments: Maintainers may join the PMC if they have at least 7 months of active participation and are nominated by an existing PMC member and approved through a formal vote.

Meeting schedule
The PMC meets quarterly or more often when required (with a minimum of 2 weeks notice).
Meeting notes and decisions are publicly archived to ensure transparency.
The quorum for PMC meetings shall be 3 people, or all PMC members if that number is lower. If the quorum is not reached, the meeting should be rescheduled for no earlier than 7 days.

### <div class="tools-header">Project management committee (PMC) Chair</div>
The PMC Chair rotates every three months, following the alphabetical order of PMC members, starting from the founding PMC list at ratification.

Responsibilities
The PMC Chair is responsible for:

* Representing the project in external communications;
* Preparing and running PMC meetings and agendas;
* Ensuring decisions and records are documented;
* Acting as interim decision-maker in emergency situations (subject to later ratification).
The role is administrative. It does not confer additional voting power or override PMC collective decision-making.

Eligibility

* Only active PMC members with at least four months of active service are eligible. New members join the rotation once this period is completed.
* If the Chair steps down mid-term, the next member in the rotation immediately assumes the role.
* If the Chair is involved in a dispute under review, another PMC member temporarily facilitates the process.

### <div class="tools-header">Contributor level and progression</div>

* Applicants: basic OSM skills; contribute mapping, testing, and issues.
* Contributors: improve data quality, propose enhancements, support documentation and tools.
* Maintainers: review and merge contributions, mentor contributors, manage repositories and roadmaps.
Progression from contributor to maintainer is based on demonstrated commitment, technical expertise, and adherence to community values. Nominations are made by existing maintainers and approved by the PMC.
Maintainers may be invited to join the Project Management Committee if nominated by an existing PMC member and approved by consensus.

## **<div class="tools-header">Decision making process</div>**

### <div class="tools-header">Routine decisions</div>
Most routine decisions use lazy consensus: a proposal is accepted if no objection is raised within 72 hours. This applies to routine maintenance, documentation, minor technical changes, and administrative matters that do not affect governance or licensing.
If someone objects, the proposer should work toward agreement before requesting a formal vote.

### <div class="tools-header">Formal voting</div>
A formal vote is used when consensus fails or when a decision has strategic, technical, financial, or legal impact.  
Any PMC member may call a vote. Maintainers may request one within their area of responsibility.  
All community members may comment, but only PMC members and Maintainers have binding votes.  
Voting options:

* +1: agree, willing to help ;
* +0: agree, not participating ;
* −0: disagree, not blocking ;
* −1: disagree, blocking with justification.

Approval thresholds

* Lazy Consensus: no objection within 72h.
* 2/3 Majority: two-thirds (appointments, licensing, funding).
* 75% Supermajority: required for amendments to this governance

Quorum & Duration
Votes require participation of at least 50% of PMC members. Votes may occur during meetings or asynchronously and must remain open 72 hours, up to 7 days for major decisions. If quorum is not reached, the vote is extended or rescheduled by the PMC Chair.

Documentation & Transparency
All proposals, votes, and results must be recorded in the project’s public governance channels, including:

* The proposal text or link to the relevant issue.
* The list of voters and their votes.
* The final decision and date.

Ties
A tied vote is not approved. The PMC Chair may cast a deciding vote only when immediate resolution is necessary; otherwise the issue returns to discussion.

### <div class="tools-header">Emergency Decisions</div>
If delay would harm the project, the PMC Chair may take temporary action without prior vote. Such actions must be reported and confirmed by the PMC at the next meeting.

## **<div class="tools-header">Amendments to the governance</div>**
Any PMC member may propose changes to this governance. The proposal must be written, shared in the public governance channel, and must include:

* A clear description of the change;
* A short rationale;
* Expected impact;
* An effective date.
The proposal is open for community comments for at least 21 days. Community and Maintainer feedback may lead to revisions of the proposal before the vote. Substantial changes may reset the comment period, to ensure time for a new review.
Amendments require a 75% supermajority of all PMC members, following standard quorum rules. All amendments must be documented and approved in the governance repository (with a Pull Request) with version history, rationale, and effective date, and announced to the community.

## **<div class="tools-header">Budget and Resources</div>**
The budget and resources are managed in alignment with the mission and in support of open tools, data, and community collaboration. Funding may come from grants, sponsorships, partnerships, or in-kind contributions.

### <div class="tools-header">Resource Allocation</div>
Resources may cover:

* People: Funded contributor time or contractor work.
* Infrastructure: Hosting, CI/CD systems, storage, security, and core services.
* Events: Conferences, workshops, meetups, and contributor summits.
* Outreach: Branding, communication materials, and community engagement.
* Development: Feature development, maintenance, and external technical support.
* Legal: Trademark, legal review, insurance, and compliance.
Funding is allocated based on available resources and project priorities defined by the PMC.

### <div class="tools-header">Decision Process & Distribution of Funds</div>
The PMC proposes and approves the annual budget, reviews it quarterly, and publishes a yearly public summary of major expenditures. Quarterly reviews allow adjustments based on project needs and available funding.

* Minor expenditures under 100 € per purchase and per month may be approved by any PMC member without a vote and must be recorded and reported at the next PMC meeting.
* Major expenditures, such as new infrastructure contracts, funded development, long-term commitments, require a formal PMC vote.
All expenditures are recorded in the funding ledger.

### <div class="tools-header">Funding and Independence</div>

Neutrality
MapYourGrid may receive financial or in-kind support from partner organizations, grants, or sponsors. Such contributions help sustain the project’s infrastructure, development, and community activities, but they do not grant special control or decision-making authority.
While partners and sponsors may contribute funding, infrastructure, or expertise, the PMC retains exclusive authority over financial decisions, budget approval, and funding strategy.

Transparency
A public annual summary of funding sources and major expenditures is published to maintain transparency. Detailed accounting records are kept internally.

Grant Applications and Paid Partnerships
Grant proposals and paid partnership applications must be prepared in coordination with the PMC. No individual or institution may use the MapYourGrid name, brand, or identity to apply for funding without explicit PMC approval.
Grant preparation and submission may be carried out by a designated Project Manager, who must be a PMC member to ensure accountability and alignment with project priorities. The Project Manager’s organization serves as the signatory, and once the grant is signed, the Project Manager oversees deliverables, reporting, and communication with funders.

Restricted Funds
Funds earmarked for specific deliverables (e.g., grant-funded work) are treated as restricted and must be used for their intended purpose. The PMC ensures that the funds are used for their intended purpose while maintaining discretion over implementation and operational choices.

## **<div class="tools-header">Conflict Resolution</div>**
MapYourGrid encourages respectful dialogue and seeks to resolve conflicts at the lowest possible level through open communication and consensus.

### <div class="tools-header">Basic principles</div>
All discussions must follow the Code of Conduct, prioritize constructive dialogue over authority, and result in documented, publicly accessible outcomes.

### <div class="tools-header">Conflict Resolution Process</div>
Conflicts should first be addressed directly between the parties involved, focusing on facts and project goals. If unresolved, a team lead or PMC Chair facilitates a structured discussion. When tensions are high, a 48-hour cooling-off period may be used before resuming talks.
If conflict remains unsolved, the PMC facilitates mediation to evaluate options and impacts across the project. If mediation fails, the PMC issues a formal decision taken by vote, documented in the governance records. The PMC may revisit a prior decision if new, relevant information arises or if all affected parties request a review.
