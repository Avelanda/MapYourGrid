<h1>MapYourGrid: Mission statement</h1>
</div>

Open data for power grids planning and maintenance is crucial to achieve energy transition and energy access, particularly in low and medium income countries.
MapYourGrid consortium states its different missions as follow:

* Empower local communities to map their power infrastructure on the OpenStreetMap project with training and tools. 
* Reuse, develop and ensure sustainable access to open data about power grids in as many countries as possible, particularly low and medium income countries, through action, education and mediation towards local communities
* Improve or create tools in accordance with OpenStreetMap community guidelines to encourage people to contribute, assess quality and curate existing data to be successfully reused for power planning
* Provide a reliable and versatile worldwide identification system for key components of power infrastructure as to ensure interoperability between as many software as possible
* Contribute to OpenStreetMap ontology for power grids to ensure consistent growth between data and modeling
* Produce relevant insights including benefits and risks, gather them in data focused tools about public data and state of the grids and promote them
