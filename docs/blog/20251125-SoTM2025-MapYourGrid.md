<h1> State of the Map 2025 : Enabling Power Grid Mapping with Appropriate Tools</h1>

:octicons-calendar-24: November 25, 2025 by Marina Petkova<br>

Part of the MapYourGrid team was in Dundee, Scotland, for [State of the Map Europe 2025](https://2025.stateofthemap.eu/index.html), and we were happy to meet and exchange with the broader OpenStreetMap community.

We ran a workshop titled ["Enabling power grid mapping with appropriate tools"](https://2025.stateofthemap.eu/session.html#VC7W9C), and talked about why open power grid data is a key enabler of the energy transition. OpenStreetMap power data is now widely recognized as reliable at a global scale, thanks to sustained contributor efforts and increasingly refined tools and field-mapping strategies that make it possible to document complex energy infrastructure. In this context, we presented the MapYourGrid initiative and its toolset in the first half of the workshop, following by practical mapping with the room. 

The workshop was designed both for OpenStreetMap contributors interested in learning power grid mapping, even without prior expertise, and for tool developers, as many of the presented tools and workflows can be reused across other mapping topics.
