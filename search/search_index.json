You can play a vital role in supporting the energy transition by helping to map electrical grids in your local area. These grids need modernization and expansion to meet the demands of electrification and decarbonization, but a lack of reliable data is a major barrier. Grid data provides governments, utilities, developers, and researchers with the information needed to plan effectively. That's where you come in.</p> <p>In recent years, OpenStreetMap has emerged as the de facto standard for global electrical grid data. However, many developing countries are still lagging behind. This gap limits rural energy access and slows down climate action:</p>        Improve data reliability and availability to better assess and manage risks for clean energy projects in emerging market and developing economies.      <p>       Key Recommendation - International Energy Agency: How to implement the COP28 energy goals </p> Towards a Globally Mapped Grid <p>       We are working with the OpenStreetMap community, organisations and individuals around the world to not only create an        open digital twin of the European grid, but also to expand global transmission grid coverage in OSM from 75% to 98% by 2028. MapYourGrid enables this through training, multiple validation strategies, optimized open-source tools and community building.</p> <p>OpenStreetMap's already extensive data on the electrical grid can be browsed on Open Infrastructure Map, showing the global scale of data collected since 2008, mostly by volunteers.</p> <p>A global community of citizen contributors creates and maintains data on the core infrastructures of our modern society.

We map transmission lines that link cities. The transmission grid infrastructure is so large that it can be traced and mapped using open satellite images. However, the distribution grid cannot be mapped sufficiently well using open satellite images alone and therefore requires strong collaboration with local communities and authorities. For this reason, this is not currently our main focus.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#wont-all-of-this-be-solved-by-ai-soon","title":"Won't all of this be solved by AI soon?","text":"<p>To ensure data quality, each data point in OpenStreetMap must be set and validated by a human. This prevents OpenStreetMap from becoming flooded with synthetic, unvalidated data that would not be suitable as ground truth in the long term. Furthermore, there are currently no detection methods that can accurately identify power towers and the course of transmission lines using classic RGB satellites alone. Grid mapping is a task that requires a high degree of expertise and contextual understanding. Due to the high relevance of this data, stochastic generation of the grid by AI is also not recommended. To validate this data, specialists must perform active grid mapping. However, we are currently evaluating the use of open-source substation detection based on Sentinel 2 data to provide another hint layer of substations for the mappers. </p>"},{"location":"faq/#does-publishing-this-data-create-a-security-risk","title":"Does Publishing this Data Create a Security Risk?","text":"<p>No, publishing grid data through MapYourGrid does not meaningfully increase security risks. This concern is understandable because electrical grids are critical infrastructure. However, multiple studies and real-world practices show that open grid data does not elevate threat levels, for several key reasons:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Much of the grid is already visible and documented. Transmission lines are easily observable in satellite imagery and by anyone on the ground. Most substations are already in platforms like Google Maps. Major institutions, including government agencies, have publicly shared detailed grid data for decades.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sophisticated actors already have better data. State-sponsored or malicious actors do not rely on OpenStreetMap. They have access to more advanced tools, commercial imagery, or even insider or cyber channels. Blocking public access doesn\u2019t prevent their activity, but it hinders legitimate use.</p> </li> <li> <p>Open data helps defenders more than attackers. Transparency allows utilities, researchers, and planners to spot weaknesses, model failures, and improve resilience. Public access to routing data supports cross-border planning and faster emergency response.</p> </li> <li> <p>\u201cSecurity through obscurity\u201d doesn\u2019t work. Hiding infrastructure details often impedes innovation and risk mitigation. As noted by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), obscurity is not a reliable security strategy.</p> </li> </ul> <p>MapYourGrid builds on a decade of public infrastructure mapping, including global comparisons showing alignment with government datasets.

StreetComplete offers simple mapping quests on the field. While it doesn't include energy-related tasks, you can still use it to leave notes on the map. For example, you can flag a power tower or a substation for later editing from a desktop tool. Organic Maps or CoMaps mobile apps can also be used to leave notes on the map.

Priority should therefore be given to large, high-voltage infrastructure first. </p> <p>Please consider the following strategies and the associated processes as recommendations only. Ultimately, the most efficient strategy is the one that enables you to work on the electrical grid with passion and motivation over a longer period of time. The strategies can be divided into two phases, with a quality assurance and validation process running alongside them.</p> <p>Pioneer Mapping Strategies: To ensure the power grid has the best possible coverage, we recommend beginning with Pioneer Mapping in each country. Several strategies are employed at this stage to identify the location of all lines, power poles, and substations. Rather than reducing issues in the grid, the main focus is on increasing extending geographic coverage of the grid. This may result in an increased total number of issues in the grid. These strategies focus primarily on mapping the geographical location of power lines, towers, plants and substations, rather than technical grid details. They require good eyesight, fast mapping skills and an understanding of situations in which satellite data is insufficient for consistent grid mapping.</p> <p>Technical Mapping Strategies: This phase involves solving complex grid issues that require a fundamental understanding of the electrical grid. This includes mapping voltages, the number of circuits and routing issues. During this phase, the initial mapping work is validated against multiple sources to ensure its plausibility. These sources could include official maps from grid operators, statistics about grid length, and other official data. The main focus of these strategies is to minimise the number of complex quality issues in the grid.</p> <p>Quality Assurance and Validation: Quality assurance runs parallel to both mapping phases and ensures that all data is verifiable, follows agreed tagging standards, is traceable, and can be reviewed by others. Tools like JOSM, Osmose, ohsome stats, and Open Infrastructure Map, along with community feedback and AI-assisted checks, help maintain the accuracy and reliability of the electrical grid data on OpenStreetMap.</p>"},{"location":"strategies/#pioneer-mapping-strategies-and-tools","title":"Pioneer Mapping Strategies and Tools","text":"Osmose Todo Plugin Map Fast Coordinates and JOSM Continue Open Lines Spot the Gaps in the Grid Connect Power Plants Connect Substations  Connect Industrial Areas  Connect WikiData"},{"location":"strategies/#osmose","title":"Osmose","text":"<p>Osmose is a quality assurance tool that detects issues in OpenStreetMap data on a daily basis.

This tool checks for common mapping errors such as: Illogical tag combinations, unusual geometries (e.g., excessively long spans between power towers) or incomplete or deprecated data. MapYourGrid created custom made Power Validation rules for JOSM named \"Power QA\".

In much of the Global South, reliable electricity grid maps are patchy at best and prohibitively expensive at worst. In some regions, the only datasets available are locked behind costly proprietary licenses, out of reach to those who need them most.</p> <p>Without accurate, open data on where transmission lines, towers, substations, and plants are located, energy planners are working blind. Renewable projects stall, cross-border integration slows, and in fast-growing emerging markets, the lack of visibility blocks economic growth, electrification, and climate resilience.</p> <p>We created MapYourGrid to close that gap and push global transmission grid coverage in OpenStreetMap from roughly 70% to 98% by 2028. We knew this couldn\u2019t be done by a single organization. It would take local mapping communities tracing lines from satellite imagery or on-site surveys, energy specialists validating data, open-source developers building better tools, and NGOs mobilizing people on the ground. </p>"},{"location":"blog/20250908-BehindTheScenes/#the-beginning-of-mapyourgrid","title":"The beginning of MapYourGrid","text":"<p>The idea for MapYourGrid started within Open Energy Transition. We had an amazing opportunity to secure support through a Breakthrough Energy grant that allowed to bring in partners, start mapping and build more appropriate tooling. </p> <p>Early in the project, we brought together four partner organisations from France and the UK with expertise in open data, cartography, and power infrastructure mapping. Their role was to anchor the initiative with deep OpenStreetMap experience. This included understanding OSM tools and how to use them for grid connectivity analysis. And also thinking about how to inform, equip, and invite OSM contributors to participate, as well as how to train and encourage energy-sector practitioners and researchers to contribute their knowledge directly to OSM. </p> <p>The initial scope was to work on at least one country per continent, focusing in particular on +60 kV transmission networks. Selecting countries also meant casting a wide net. We had to look at many possibilities, testing both the feasibility of mapping and the availability of official information on the state of their transmission networks. This process of exploration and verification led to the creation of our list of publicly available grid maps, a running record of the countries we examined and the sources we checked. </p> <p>Initially, the idea was to use existing open datasets on transmission grids as a starting point, evaluating their maturity, determining whether they could be relied on, and, where possible, using them to support mapping in the selected countries. In practice, many of the datasets we found and analysed reviewed to be incomplete, outdated, or not sufficiently verifiable for our purposes. This made clear that we could not rely only on external datasets for our work. Instead, we turned to mapping strategies : structured workflows using satellite imagery, ground surveys where possible, and contributor validation. This means that we were able to map a lot of the transmission lines ourselves and thus create new, verifiable data in OpenStreetMap, that can be used and maintained by the community. </p> <p>Another one of the early needs identified during our discussions was to clarify the set of editing and quality-control tools we would use. In particular, we needed to clarify the role of Osmose. Osmose is a quality-assurance tool widely used in the OSM ecosystem. It scans the map data, detects potential issues or inconsistencies, and suggests corrections to contributors. For us, Osmose provides a systematic way to check whether power lines, substations, and other infrastructure are mapped correctly and consistently across regions. It also complements other tools by Open Energy Transition, such as PyPSA-Earth, by ensuring that the raw OSM data is reliable before being used in connectivity analyses. </p> <p>So in March 2025, the core team was formally established, bringing together Open Energy Transition, Datactivist, Dynartio, Jungle Bus and Infrageomatics. With the partnership in place and the first strands of work underway, it became clear that the project\u2019s impact would depend as much on the people contributing as on the tools and methods themselves. </p>"},{"location":"blog/20250908-BehindTheScenes/#the-people-that-power-mapyourgrid","title":"The people that power MapYourGrid","text":""},{"location":"blog/20250908-BehindTheScenes/#our-core-team","title":"Our Core Team","text":"<p>We are developers, data scientists, power grid experts, cartographers, and OpenStreetMap contributors.

Some are already lined up for interviews, podcasts, and blog posts we\u2019ll be sharing soon.</p> <p>Within days, new people joined our Discord and the first feedback from the community came in. That feedback has been valuable, because it gives us a fresh look at how people actually use the tools and points out where we should focus our efforts. Hearing different perspectives helps us make immediate improvements, instead of waiting for problems to pile up. In a collaborative project like this, the feedback loop is important. It means that the community shapes the project just as much as the project supports the community.</p> <p>In the week after the launch, we noticed more contributors tagging their OpenStreetMap changesets with the project\u2019s hashtag #mapyourgrid. In that time, about 12,000 power towers were mapped by people outside our team. The total of contributors using our hashtag went up from 14 to 29, a clear sign that news of the project was getting around and that others were willing to invest time in mapping.</p> <p>The launch confirmed that there was interest and capacity in the wider community. The next step was to focus that momentum on a clear set of priorities.</p>"},{"location":"blog/20250908-BehindTheScenes/#what-comes-next-for-mapyourgrid","title":"What comes next for MapYourGrid","text":"<p>What you see today is just a start. Over the next six months, our work will concentrate on three priorities: One is the production of a complete and consistent map of all power interconnectors worldwide, using OpenStreetMap as the base dataset. This involves systematically checking whether every known interconnector is present and correctly mapped in OSM, and adding or correcting data where it is missing or inaccurate. The goal is to have a dataset that can be trusted for both technical studies and planning purposes.</p> <p>Another focus is contributor training. We are working on text and video tutorials, as well as live mapping workshops, so contributors can map their national transmission grids with confidence. As of writing this article, we are in discussion with mappers from Myanmar, Pakistan, Canada, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. These conversations are also shaping the training approach to suit different contexts. Our aim is not only to show communities how to map their grids in detail, but also to create the conditions for peer-to-peer learning. This means contributors exchanging techniques, tools, and validation methods directly with one another, without having to rely solely on the core project team. Hopefully, this will allow knowledge to circulate more widely and make contributors work with more ease.</p> <p>We are also mapping two specific countries in detail: Zambia and Colombia that we will use as case studies. We chose them because they have enough open and partial grid data to map confidently, and yet both still have significant mapping gaps and the context to fill them. Zambia, with its growing solar development and its heavy hydropower reliance, presents an opportunity to test how our tools handle a grid in transition. Colombia, meanwhile, is actively diversifying its energy mix : currently dominated by hydropower, but with growing wind and solar programs and ambitious targets for clean energy. These cases serve as practical tests for our existing tools, particularly PowerPlantMatching and PyPSA-Earth, and will help us understand how they perform when applied to complete country-scale datasets. The results will feed directly into improving our methods for mapping and validating grids elsewhere.</p> <p>We choose these three priorities because they address three critical gaps we\u2019ve seen repeatedly : missing data on cross-border connections, the need for practical skills in local mapping communities, and the challenge of testing and refining tools on complete grids.</p> <p>The scope of work is far larger than our core team. Interconnectors cross borders, validation requires different technical backgrounds, and building confident mapping communities depends on people with local knowledge. Whether you can map from imagery, validate data in the field, write code, or run a workshop, your contribution will improve both the map and the methods behind it. If you have skills, data, or time to share, we invite you to join the effort. The global transmission grid will keep changing. The more people we have mapping and maintaining it, the more useful it will be to everyone.</p>"},{"location":"blog/20250918-HIFLD/","title":"20250918 HIFLD","text":"OpenStreetMap grid data, the hidden superhero of the US\u2019 national security? <p> September 18, 2025 by Andreas Hernandez Denyer</p> <p>California wildfires, the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack, hurricane and flooding responses such as Hurricane Maria, all have something in common: EAGLE-I. EAGLE-I (Environment for Analysis of Geo-Located Energy Information), developed by the US Department of Energy, is an emergency and strategic planning system used to monitor energy infrastructure, coordinate emergency responses, and restore critical energy systems. What these tools also incorporate is data. A lot of data.</p> <p>One of the fundamental layers of data used by these tools comes from the Homeland Infrastructure Foundation Level Data (HIFLD), which contains electric power transmission lines for all of the US. What many don\u2019t know is that a relatively large portion of this grid data has OpenStreetMap as one of the sources, and in some cases OpenStreetMap is the only source. Indeed, around 25% of features in the data layer have OpenStreetMap as a source, which is roughly 301,600km out of the 950,500km of electric power lines (32%) of the US. You sometimes hear people doubt the usefulness and quality of OpenStreetMap data since it\u2019s community-driven. However, it\u2019s clear that the US HIFLD deems it to be reliable to be incorporated into its datasets, and thus the tooling that relies on this data, which in turn are used for large-scale decision-making.</p> <p>For example, the URBAN-NET tool incorporated in EAGLE-I, developed by ONRL, is used by: the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER), FEMA, and other state, federal, and local agencies. It was used for example in the case of a cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline in 2021, to understand how the gas pipeline shutdown affected crude flows and refinery operations. However, gas is intertwined with power grids, so having a tool like URBAN-NET that can represent the dependencies between different energy resources is key in making reliable assessments. However, what is needed for these assessments to be accurate? Data. </p> <p>Some have security worries with grid infrastructure location data being open, however many studies and practices show that this data being open does not elevate threat levels. Furthermore, critical infrastructure such as substations can be easily seen and located in Earth observation and satellite imagery data such as Google Maps, which sophisticated actors would already be aware of. Locations and images of substations can be found online, with for example Google Maps listing most of the larger substations' location, including on sight images, all around the world since 20 years. So, if anything, the usage of OpenStreetMap data in HIFLD datasets, shows how national security can be increased due to better data, and thus better planning and modelling.</p> <p>So, OpenStreetMap grid data is therefore an important source as it has, and can be used to validate existing sources, and can also be the only source of grid data there is. Furthermore, since the future of this data is unclear due to the decision of removing HIFLD Open Data which you can read about here, OpenStreetMap could play an ever increasing role as the foundation for open power grid data. With the MapYourGrid initiative, this is what we are trying to achieve globally.</p> <p></p> <p>More sources and usage of EAGLE-I and potentially HIFLD grid data 1) Creating Foundation Electric Energy Infrastructure Data from Open-Sources  2) Component Assessment of the Electric Transmission Grid to Hurricanes 3) US Department of Energy: Grid-Enhancing Technologies:A Case Study on Ratepayer Impact 4) US Department of Energy: National Transmission Needs Study:Supplemental Material 5) Wildfire webinar mentioning how the \"power infrastructure layer\" is useful</p> <p>MapYourGrid is a free, open-source initiative supported by Open Energy Transition, Datactivist, Dynartio, Jungle Bus, Infrageomatics.</p>"},{"location":"blog/20251125-SoTM2025-MapYourGrid/","title":"20251125 SoTM2025 MapYourGrid","text":"State of the Map 2025 : Enabling Power Grid Mapping with Appropriate Tools <p> November 25, 2025 by Marina Petkova</p> <p>Part of the MapYourGrid team was in Dundee, Scotland, for State of the Map Europe 2025, and we were happy to meet and exchange with the broader OpenStreetMap community.</p> <p>We ran a workshop titled \"Enabling power grid mapping with appropriate tools\", and talked about why open power grid data is a key enabler of the energy transition.

Furthermore, our approach allows for people to add to the open database, comment if there are mistakes, update the data, and validate it since all sources are indicated. Open data and Open Source allows for stringent validation, and can guarantee higher levels of quality.</p> <p> We wanted to know how much of the grid is mapped in OpenStreetMap, globally, per country and per voltage level. Being able to compare this with official data, now allows the community and MapYourGrid to see the coverage missing (or not!) in detail, and to attribute a quality score to a country\u2019s grid. </p> <p>So, in total this gives us a high-voltage grid estimate of at least 7.3 million circuit kilometres. Thus, we now estimate that around 75% of the world\u2019s high-voltage grid is mapped in OpenStreetMap. This calculation can be done by looking at the total length in OpenStreetMap (50kv+) on OpenInfraMap.</p> <p>Scope: The scope of the database is high-voltage lines, with an emphasis on transmission. However, we do include high-voltage distribution lines in some countries (eg. 132kv). Definitions and standards of \u201ctransmission\u201d, \u201cdistribution\u201d, \u201chigh-voltage\u201d differ between countries, which can complicate analyses and comparisons.</p> <p>Indeed, for some  countries, particularly developing countries, certain high-voltage (which we define in our spreadsheet as 50kv+) will be operated and reported by the transmission system operator (TSO), such as 66kv or 115kv lines. In other countries, this will fall under high-voltage or extra high-voltage distribution. Furthermore, it is possible for distribution system operators (DSO) to operate 220kv lines, and in contrast some lines (although in terms of kilometres this will be small) at quite low voltage will be operated by the TSO. Moreover, in the International Energy Agency\u2019s \u201cElectricity Grids and Secure Energy Transitions\u201d report, on page 51 you can find that transmission includes 36kv+, not 50kv+ as we do. However, in the IEA's \"Building the Future Transmission Grid\" report, the scope of transmission is 66kv+ for example.</p> <p>In a few high-income countries, numbers for 50kV-132kV lines were hard to find. In those cases, the 50kV+ number in our database is an under-estimate (eg. US, Canada, Brazil).  In contrast, other countries, such as China, published a high-voltage line length for all 35kV+ lines. In that case, our database may include numbers for lines below 50kV. </p> <p>Finally, we concentrated on circuit line length and not route line length. However, many countries do not specify if their reported numbers are circuit or route length, and some only disclose route lengths.</p> <p>In the future, a separate sheet tab could be created to measure distribution lengths, and a clear distinction between distribution and transmission should be made in the long-term. As of now, our database includes some high-voltage distribution, but this is always indicated in the notes or calculations (if known).</p> <p>Methodology: The workflow developed was:  First, go through the transmission system operator\u2019s (TSO) website and find the numbers there. Dedicated pages, annual reports, and network development plans were generally the best places to find the data. \u2018Open data\u2019 pages were useful too.</p> <p>For many countries though this strategy did not work, so going through the ministry of energy\u2019s reports sometimes worked, or the energy/electricity regulator too. Electricity regulators in certain cases can even be better, as many countries have multiple TSOs, which means it is faster to find the aggregated numbers in their websites/reports.</p> <p>In terms of formats, some included digital atlas\u2019 or open data (csv, geojson,shp), so numbers could be extracted there too. However, in certain cases some data processing in QGIS to calculate circuit line lengths, or to calculate line lengths per voltage level was needed (eg. UK and the numerous distribution system operators (DSO) that operate 132kv).</p> <p>For most countries where needed and where possible, extra steps were taken to include high-voltage lines operated by DSOs such as Spain, Czech Republic and the UK. The \u2018notes\u2019 or \u2018calculations\u2019 section will give insights on if a country\u2019s line length includes high-voltage distribution.</p> <p>One important potential caveat, is how countries themselves measure line lengths, as incorporating the sag of the line or not can have a large impact. In the case of this spreadsheet, these potential details and distinctions per country have not been made, but could be of interest in the future.</p> <p>Another important note is direct current and alternating current. For most DC voltages, a column was created. However, for 500kv both 500kv AC and DC were included in the same column. </p> <p>The operating voltage was ideally used instead of the design voltage. However, in some cases this information was not reported so it is possible that the length of one voltage range should be placed in another. Where this is the case, some notes have been written such as Malaysia, which has some 500kv operated at 275kv.</p> <p>A VPN was needed for certain countries, and speaking multiple languages helps save a lot of time, but browser translations are also useful. Searching for keywords such as \u2018km\u2019, \u2018kilometre\u2019, \u2018length\u2019, \u2018kv\u2019 will be useful. However, certain reports are not text, or have a different way of typing \u2018km\u2019 for example so it would not appear in a search. Learning the short words for high voltage or extra-high voltage like \u2018VVN\u2019 in some Eastern European countries, can also save time.</p> <p>Some Insights: The total number of 7.3 million ckm is most likely an underestimation itself. Certain big countries which are highly electrified dominate global length, and thus having accurate data for these countries can have a large impact on a global number. For example, if one could aggregate all 66kv and 132kv line lengths for Brazil, this would immediately increase the total length by at least 200,000km. The same could be said for the US. On the other hand, it is also complex to compare with other sources such as the IEA, as they might not be taking high-voltage distribution lines, which can explain why their number is slightly lower (although unlikely). But since this data is closed, we cannot know!</p> <p>OpenStreetMap as a way to cross-validate: Using OpenStreetMap, and particularly our quality grid health score, was a very good way to validate: the correct voltage level if a range is given by the official data, find cases where high-voltage is operated by DSOs too, validate if the numbers given are route-km or circuit-km, and see if the official data makes sense or is outdated. An example is India, where its official data lumped 220kv and 230kv together, but almost all lines mapped in OpenStreetMap have been tagged as 220kv. I also managed to find mistakes in the reporting of the official data (double counting) for certain countries.</p> <p>Interpretation of the coverage quality health score: In our globe health score, we include the coverage score which compares circuit length of OpenStreetMap data and the official data present in the spreadsheet, per country and per voltage if available.</p> <p>One important thing to keep in mind is that we are measuring circuit line length, not just route. This means that in the health score, many kilometres of lines seemingly might be missing, but this could just be that lines are not tagged with the appropriate \u2018circuit\u2019 tag. A good example is when the quality score says exactly 50% for a given voltage. Here it is likely that all the lines in terms of coverage have been mapped, but that all these lines have 2 circuits in reality, and have not been tagged. So simply tagging the lines with \u2018circuits=2\u2019, would double the circuit line length, and reach a 100% quality score.</p> <p>Another important thing to consider is the voltage tag, as lines not tagged with voltage, will obviously not be compared with the length of the official data. Therefore, it is possible that lines have physically been mapped, but due to a missing voltage tag, the coverage score will be much lower.</p> <p>What can help to see if the issue is just tagging, or the actual coverage of lines is missing, is by looking at the \u2018quality\u2019 score, specifically the proportion of lines missing voltage tags and circuit tags. If this score is high, but coverage is low, then it is clear that lines are missing and need to be mapped.</p> <p>You can contribute! The database is fully open and under a CC BY 4.0 License.

For years, OpenStreetMap's power data underwent the same standard verification and quality control processes as the rest of the OpenStreetMap data. Apart from Bobby Xiong\u2019s 2024 comparison of OpenStreetMap data and the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity's official data, few large-scale assessments have evaluated its quality in a systematic way. But when we began mapping intensively, country after country, my perspective on this data drastically changed. Nearly everything that was already mapped could be verified using satellite imagery. The main issues we still can find are: </p> <ul> <li>Gaps in lines and missing lines in regions with outdated imagery. This has been one of the main challenges we have encountered in low-income countries, particularly in Africa and Asia.  </li> <li>Missing critical attributes for energy system modelling such as voltages or number of circuits. These values are missing because they require specialised training and tools to map via imagery.</li> </ul> <p>But the fundamental geometry and asset mapping? Surprisingly consistent. Our quality assurance work at the end of the year confirmed this. Using the Osmose QA platform, we checked for rule-based issues like voltage inconsistencies, missing tags, and mismatched substation names. The results showed a dataset that was already far more complete and internally consistent than most people expect it to be. And the strongest proof of quality comes from an unexpected direction: Most AI models use OpenStreetMap as ground truth.</p> <p>From satellite-based solar asset detection to global renewable energy monitoring, OpenStreetMap\u2019s data enables AI to distinguish between true and false information about power infrastructure, including wind turbines and substations. As part of the AI training process, existing data is re-detected by the AI and compared with OpenStreetMap data for validation purposes. Therefore, each new training set further demonstrates the high quality of OSM's data. This is the main problem we are facing. While AI developments are important for detecting and locating new and missing data, most of these developments release new datasets without contributing to the training datasets from which they have benefited.

Contrary to what many claim publicly, these are the only global, interregional geospatial datasets on the transmission grid that are accessible and consistently structured. Why? Because mapping the grid requires context awareness. Even sophisticated AI models can reliably detect only a small set of features like substations and power plants. But the rest of the essential attributes require human interpretation: Routing of circuits, number of circuits per line, voltage levels, substation and line names, relations between assets and confirmation against multiple imagery sources and documents. This dataset is simply too important and too complex to be built from unverified AI outputs.</p> <p>Automation and AI is undoubtedly helpful and we rely on it heavily to provide support for mappers, detect issues and speed up workflows.

While well-structured datasets exist in Mexico, Brazil, Thailand, Egypt, countries such as Canada, Spain, and Italy still show substantial room for improvement.</p> <p>Globally, the main weakness is the lack of information regarding line voltage, the number of cables and the number of circuits across many parts of the network. It is challenging to derive these attributes from aerial imagery alone, and they require either local knowledge or an advanced understanding of power grid mapping.

Esta preocupaci\u00f3n es comprensible porque las redes el\u00e9ctricas son infraestructuras cr\u00edticas. Sin embargo, m\u00faltiples estudios y pr\u00e1cticas del mundo real demuestran que los datos de red abiertos no elevan los niveles de amenaza, por varias razones clave:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Gran parte de la red ya es visible y est\u00e1 documentada. Las l\u00edneas de transmisi\u00f3n son f\u00e1cilmente observables en im\u00e1genes por sat\u00e9lite y por cualquiera que est\u00e9 sobre el terreno.

Los actores maliciosos o patrocinados por el Estado no conf\u00edan en OpenStreetMap. Tienen acceso a herramientas m\u00e1s avanzadas, im\u00e1genes comerciales o incluso canales internos o cibern\u00e9ticos.

La transparencia permite a empresas de servicios p\u00fablicos, investigadores y planificadores detectar puntos d\u00e9biles, modelar fallos y mejorar la resistencia.

In some countries, the mapping of transmission lines is not permitted. Get in touch with local users by finding out about your local communities and local projects.  If you can't find a local community, please send us an email and we will help you set up a local group.</p> <p>By following our Good practices for mapping, we collectively protect the integrity of the OpenStreetMap platform, foster trust with communities, and unlock the power of open data for a more resilient and just energy future. Please do NOT copy any data from hint layer directly into your OpenStreetMap data layer. Every data point in your OpenStreetMap data layer must be manually set and verified. The metadata must also be verified against compatible licensed sources or by people on the ground. If you cannot verify the data using satellite images or any other compatible source, please do not add this information from hint layers. This may seem like a high burden at first, but it ensures the high quality of OpenStreetMap. </p> <p>Risk of Double Mapping</p> <p>Please bear in mind that you have only downloaded transmission grid data for the country, state or province that you selected. This includes power plants, generators, substations, power towers and transmission lines. Other OpenStreetMap objects, such as streets, will not be visible. Therefore, never use our tools to map objects other than those loaded via Overpass, as otherwise other mappers will have to clean up the duplicate data.</p> <p>Some cross-border transmission lines will still be visible beyond the pink administrative boundaries. However, to edit these, you will need to load both countries. Never map beyond the pink administrative boundaries, as this will most likely result in infrastructure being mapped twice.</p>"},{"location":"es/map-it/#join-the-chat","title":"Join the Chat","text":"<p>We welcome everyone to join our \ud83d\udccd-MapYourGrid discord channel.

Durante esta fase, el trabajo inicial de cartograf\u00eda se valida con m\u00faltiples fuentes para garantizar su plausibilidad.

Cette inqui\u00e9tude est compr\u00e9hensible car les r\u00e9seaux \u00e9lectriques sont des infrastructures critiques. Cependant, de nombreuses \u00e9tudes et des pratiques concr\u00e8tes montrent que l'ouverture des donn\u00e9es de r\u00e9seau n'augmente pas les niveaux de menace, et ce pour plusieurs raisons essentielles :</p> <ul> <li> <p>Une grande partie du r\u00e9seau est d\u00e9j\u00e0 visible et document\u00e9e. Les lignes de transmission sont facilement observables sur les images satellites et par toute personne sur le terrain. La plupart des sous-stations figurent d\u00e9j\u00e0 sur des plateformes telles que Google Maps. Les grandes institutions, y compris les agences gouvernementales, partagent publiquement des donn\u00e9es d\u00e9taill\u00e9es sur le r\u00e9seau depuis des d\u00e9cennies.</p> </li> <li> <p>Les acteurs sophistiqu\u00e9s disposent d\u00e9j\u00e0 de meilleures donn\u00e9es. Les acteurs parrain\u00e9s par un \u00c9tat ou malveillants ne se fient pas \u00e0 OpenStreetMap. Ils ont acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des outils plus avanc\u00e9s, \u00e0 des images commerciales, voire \u00e0 des canaux internes ou cybern\u00e9tiques. Le blocage de l'acc\u00e8s public n'emp\u00eache pas leur activit\u00e9, mais il entrave l'utilisation l\u00e9gitime.</p> </li> <li> <p>Les donn\u00e9es ouvertes aident davantage les d\u00e9fenseurs que les attaquants. La transparence permet aux services publics, aux chercheurs et aux planificateurs de rep\u00e9rer les faiblesses, de mod\u00e9liser les d\u00e9faillances et d'am\u00e9liorer la r\u00e9silience. L'acc\u00e8s public aux donn\u00e9es d'acheminement favorise la planification transfrontali\u00e8re et une r\u00e9ponse plus rapide aux situations d'urgence.</p> </li> <li> <p>La s\u00e9curit\u00e9 par l'obscurit\u00e9\" ne fonctionne pas. La dissimulation des d\u00e9tails de l'infrastructure entrave souvent l'innovation et l'att\u00e9nuation des risques. Comme le souligne l'Institut national am\u00e9ricain des normes et de la technologie (NIST), l'obscurit\u00e9 n'est pas une strat\u00e9gie de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 fiable.</p> </li> </ul> <p>MapYourGrid s'appuie sur une d\u00e9cennie de cartographie des infrastructures publiques, y compris des comparaisons mondiales montrant l'alignement avec les ensembles de donn\u00e9es gouvernementales. Notre mission est de d\u00e9mocratiser l'acc\u00e8s aux donn\u00e9es pour favoriser la r\u00e9silience, la transparence et l'innovation, et non d'exposer ce que les adversaires ne savent pas d\u00e9j\u00e0.

Get started with transmission grid mapping in OpenStreetMap by checking out our Starter Kit Tutorial and our community discord channel.</p> <p>\u26a0\ufe0f These datasets, maps and resources can help you to estimate grid coverage in OpenStreetMap and identify missing lines. Do not copy/paste data directly from these maps into your OpenStreetMap layer, and always keep your data separate from OpenStreetMap data in your editor. Each data point of the transmission network must be set manually and verified with official satellite data provided by the OpenStreetMap community. \u26a0\ufe0f </p> <p>  If a resource link is broken, or you find a map with a broken link that you'd like to add to this list, try it on the Internet Archive.

In some countries, the mapping of transmission lines is not permitted. Get in touch with local users by finding out about your local communities and local projects.  If you can't find a local community, please send us an email and we will help you set up a local group.</p> <p>By following our Good practices for mapping, we collectively protect the integrity of the OpenStreetMap platform, foster trust with communities, and unlock the power of open data for a more resilient and just energy future. Please do NOT copy any data from hint layer directly into your OpenStreetMap data layer. Every data point in your OpenStreetMap data layer must be manually set and verified. The metadata must also be verified against compatible licensed sources or by people on the ground. If you cannot verify the data using satellite images or any other compatible source, please do not add this information from hint layers. This may seem like a high burden at first, but it ensures the high quality of OpenStreetMap. </p> <p>Risk of Double Mapping</p> <p>Please bear in mind that you have only downloaded transmission grid data for the country, state or province that you selected. This includes power plants, generators, substations, power towers and transmission lines. Other OpenStreetMap objects, such as streets, will not be visible. Therefore, never use our tools to map objects other than those loaded via Overpass, as otherwise other mappers will have to clean up the duplicate data.</p> <p>Some cross-border transmission lines will still be visible beyond the pink administrative boundaries. However, to edit these, you will need to load both countries. Never map beyond the pink administrative boundaries, as this will most likely result in infrastructure being mapped twice.</p>"},{"location":"fr/map-it/#join-the-chat","title":"Join the Chat","text":"<p>We welcome everyone to join our \ud83d\udccd-MapYourGrid discord channel.

En fin de compte, la strat\u00e9gie la plus efficace est celle qui vous permet de travailler sur le r\u00e9seau \u00e9lectrique avec passion et motivation pendant une longue p\u00e9riode.

Il peut en r\u00e9sulter une augmentation du nombre total de probl\u00e8mes dans le r\u00e9seau. Ces strat\u00e9gies se concentrent principalement sur la cartographie de l'emplacement g\u00e9ographique des lignes \u00e9lectriques, des pyl\u00f4nes, des centrales et des sous-stations, plut\u00f4t que sur les d\u00e9tails techniques du r\u00e9seau.

Il s'agit notamment de cartographier les tensions, le nombre de circuits et les probl\u00e8mes d'acheminement. Au cours de cette phase, le travail de cartographie initial est valid\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 plusieurs sources afin de s'assurer de sa plausibilit\u00e9. Ces sources peuvent \u00eatre des cartes officielles des op\u00e9rateurs de r\u00e9seau, des statistiques sur la longueur du r\u00e9seau et d'autres donn\u00e9es officielles.
