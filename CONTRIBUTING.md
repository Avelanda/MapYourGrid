## Thanks for taking the time to contribute! ❤️

We encourage and value any type of contribution. See the [Readme.md](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/MapYourGrid/tree/main) for how to contribute to the website and make a pull request. If it's a big change, please make sure to understand the architecture of the website, which you can find it [here](docs/images/contribute/Mapit-architecture.jpg) or [here](docs/images/contribute/Mapit-architecture.jpg) for Map It. It will make it a lot easier for us maintainers and smooth out the experience for all involved. The community looks forward to your contributions. 🎉
